		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>I moved in with Megan in the autum of 2014, and at first we were
			looking at getting settled there. For a while I was hunting for a job 
			and Megan was working her way up the accounting ladder! She came home one day and mentioned that 
			she could move between offices with PwC. Other people she worked with
			had talked about heading to New Zealand and that sowed the seed in out minds.
			Whilst looking into the idea we found a blog by a canadian couple. This was 
			a real inspiration(check it out <a href ="http://www.stokedforsaturday.com/">here</a>), and then things sort of fell into place.
			<br>
			So by May (for Megan) and June (for me) 2015 we were in Wellington!
